# 🩺 Machine Learning–Based Breast Cancer Detection and Classification System

**CancerScan AI** is an end-to-end **Machine Learning–powered web application** that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant** using clinically significant diagnostic features.

The system is built using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset** and deployed as a **Flask-based web application** with a clean, mobile-friendly user interface.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is developed **strictly for academic and educational purposes only**. It must **not** be used for real-world medical diagnosis or clinical decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **569 patient samples** with **32 columns**, including:

* `id` → Non-predictive (dropped)
* `diagnosis` → Target label
* **30 real-valued diagnostic features**, such as:

  * `radius_mean`
  * `texture_mean`
  * `perimeter_mean`
  * `area_mean`
  * `concavity_worst`
  * `symmetry_worst`
  * `fractal_dimension_worst`

These features represent **quantitative measurements of cell nuclei** extracted from digitized breast tissue images.
